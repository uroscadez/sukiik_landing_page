              Introducing the SUUK IIK II, a sensational new flagship for luxury sailing charters: built just two years ago in Greifswald, Germany, she epitomizes next-generation performance, elegance, and experience. From her sleek carbon-infused hull to the intelligent, flowing interior spaces drenched in natural light, SUUK IIK II is as much a work of art as she is a vessel. Designed under the banner of the YYachts Y8 line, she offers an expansive 20 % more interior volume than her predecessors, a deep, balanced keel for razor-sharp stability, and a host of innovations like a transverse stern garage, self-tacking jib, and a thoughtfully placed engine room that lowers her center of gravity for superior handling.

            Now available for charter under the expert care of Tony Lovec Yacht Management, in collaboration with Zarpo, every detail of SUUK IIK II has been curated for an unforgettable experience. Whether gliding under sail across azure seas, entertaining guests on deck beneath the open sky, or retreating below into bespoke lounges and staterooms, she offers a seamless blend of speed, safety, and serenity. Embark on SUUK IIK II and discover what it means to charter not just a yacht, but a floating realm of freedom, refined style, and pure maritime exhilaration.
